# <Horiseon-Code-Refactor>

## Description

I took the code for the Horiseon website and refactored it to make sure all code was in working order, the CSS matched up with the HTML and it was a DRY code/removed redundancies.
I built this project to practice having a clean working code and making sure my CSS and HTML sheets worked well together. The results ensured a working website with clean code on the backend.
